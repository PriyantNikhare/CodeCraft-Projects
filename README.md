# CodeCraft Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of the **CodeCraft** activity, where logic, creativity, and code come together to push the boundaries of innovation. The projects include a stack reversal, three-sum problem solution, graph traversal using DFS, and website development. Each project demonstrates problem-solving, algorithm implementation, and web development skills. This is part of our college activity at **Jhulelal Institute of Technology, Nagpur**.

## Project List

1. **Reverse a Stack**
   - **Description**: This project reverses a stack of integers using only stack operations (push and pop). No additional data structures are used.
   - **Implementation**: The stack is reversed through recursive or iterative stack operations.
   - **Languages Used**: Python/JavaScript/Java (Choose as per implementation).
   - **File**: [ReverseStack.java](./ReverseStack.java)

2. **Three Sum Problem**
   - **Description**: Finds all unique triplets in an array of integers that sum to zero.
   - **Implementation**: Utilizes sorting and a two-pointer approach to find unique triplets.
   - **Languages Used**: Python/JavaScript/Java (Choose as per implementation).
   - **File**: [ThreeSum.java](./ThreeSum.java)

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
   - **Description**: Implements DFS traversal for a graph represented by an adjacency list. The traversal starts from a given vertex and visits all connected vertices.
   - **Implementation**: A recursive approach to visit nodes in depth-first order.
   - **Languages Used**: Python/JavaScript/Java (Choose as per implementation).
   - **File**: [DFS.java](./DFS.java)

4. **Simple Website**
   - **Description**: A static website with a homepage, about page, contact page, and blog page. Includes navigation links and a welcoming message.
   - **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
   - **Files**: 
     - [index.html](./website/index.html)
     - [about.html](./website/about.html)
     - [contact.html](./website/contact.html)
     - [blog.html](./website/blog.html)
     - [styles.css](./website/styles.css)
     - [script.js](./website/script.js)

5. **Responsive Social Media Platform**
   - **Description**: A responsive social media UI implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design adapts to both desktop and mobile devices, with features like swipe gestures on touch devices.
   - **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
   - **Files**: 
     - [index.html](./social-platform/index.html)
     - [styles.css](./social-platform/styles.css)
     - [script.js](./social-platform/script.js)
